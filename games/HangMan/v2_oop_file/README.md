## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure you are in the **project root directory**
2. Compile the program:

```bash
javac HangMan/v2_oop_file/Main.java
java HangMan.v2_oop_file.Main

📄 words.txt Format

Location: HangMan/v2_oop_file/words.txt

One word per line

No spaces inside words

Example:

apple
banana
computer
java
hangman

🧠 How the Game Works

Words are loaded from words.txt

One word is selected randomly

Player guesses one letter at a time

Correct guesses reveal letters

Wrong guesses draw the hangman

Game ends when:

All letters are guessed (Win)

6 wrong guesses occur (Game Over)

⚠️ Notes

words.txt must exist and must not be empty

File paths are relative to where the program is executed

Input must be a single alphabet character
