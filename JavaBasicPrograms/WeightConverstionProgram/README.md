Weight Conversion Program

v1_basic     - basic procedural version
v2_oop  - OOP version


Most programs have been upgraded to a v2_oop version to demonstrate
improvement using Object-Oriented Programming.

A few very small programs were intentionally left as single-class
implementations, as converting them into multiple classes would not
add meaningful value.
